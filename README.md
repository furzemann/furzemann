Hi, I go by the alias of furzemann online. I'm currently an Engineering student going through a development phase. I do programming in JavaScript, Python and C and currently am looking into systems languages like rust and go. I think my best leisure activities are listening to music and gaming but I am a content consoomer too.
I'm just getting the gang of GitHub and Open Source and have a strong desire to contribute to projects especially in the gamedev and ML space. To contact me, you can find me on discord as freeze77.
